Angular App - Seed by Haukur
=====================

---------------

This seed is simple and to the point. Nothing more to say.

----------
#### Key features. ####
----------

 1. **Gulp** - Uses Gulp to minify and builds project files and watches for changes while you code.
 2. **NG Structure** - Uses structure that makes sense and is used in practice.
 3. **NG Filters** - Some built-in filters I find useful.
 3. **Bower** - Uses bower to have JS libraries under control.
<<<<<<< HEAD
 4. **Bootstrap** - Ready for using Bootstrap with bootstrap directives for AngularJS.
 5. **Icons** - FontAwesome and Ionic awesomeness.
 6. **Helpers** - Libraries that I cannot be without: Moment, Underscore and jQuery Core.
 7. **Sass** - Allows using Sass as a project styling preprocessor. Sass is built with gulp-sass.

- npm [http://www.npmjs.org/][3]
